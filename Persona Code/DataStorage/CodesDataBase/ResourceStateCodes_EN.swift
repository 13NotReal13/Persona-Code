Your immune system is generally strong, and your vitality allows you to overcome even serious illnesses when they occur.

Overexertion, lack of sleep, chronic stress, and overload are the main factors that may cause malfunctions in your body. You often fail to notice the early signs of fatigue and continue moving forward until a sharp energy drop occurs.

                    In the long term, this may lead to cardiovascular issues, muscle strain, and nervous exhaustion. It is important to recognize your limits and avoid overloading yourself. Regular rest, moderate physical activity, and stress management will help you preserve your outstanding resource for years to come.
